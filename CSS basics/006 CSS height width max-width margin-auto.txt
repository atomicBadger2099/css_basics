CSS: Height, Width, and Max-Width with margin:auto

   The height and width of a CSS object can be redone by using height, width, and max-width:

   all these can be done in multiple forms of measurement: px and % are the most common.

   The common practice is to put objects in a div and use these and box model elements to resize.

   max-width can be used to set a rigid breakpoint in size. 
   max-width is often used with margin:auto; to control divs.

example:

   .div_class {
                    height:100%;
                    max-width:50%;
                    margin:auto;
                    }
