CSS Basic Selectors:


CSS can have a variety of selector types.

The most typical selectors used in CSS are:

  - element (default): example
      h1{ 
           color:red;
          }

  - id selectors: example

      in html code: <h1 id ="banner_1">
      in CSS file: #banner_1 {
                                          font-size:40px;
                                          font-family: monospace;
                                          }

  - class selectors: example

      in html code: <div class="text_section">

      in CSS file: .text_section {
                                            font-size:16px; 
                                            font-family:sans-serif;
                                            }

  These three are essential to learn as soon as possible. They are the most common use cases.

    

But there are other selector types that exist. Selectors fall into the following classes:
  each of these needs to be learned independently.

   - simple selectors (element, class, ID)
   - combinator selectors
   - attribute selectors
   - pseudo-element selectors
   - pseudo-class selectors
